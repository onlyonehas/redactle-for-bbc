    "Swindon Borough Council is expected to increase parking charges at Coate Water Park",
    "Visitors to a popular walking spot could have to pay more to park from next April.",
    "Swindon Borough Council is proposing increasing the charges at Coate Water Park in Wiltshire, with a decision expected to be made at a full council meeting in the new year.",
    "The cost to park for two hours is expected to rise by 70p, while the charge for longer than two hours will increase by 20p, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.",
    "Councillor Kevin Small, the cabinet member for finance, said the rise was \"appropriate\" and \"that the market can sustain that increase\".",
    "The council said it was also proposing increasing the cost of an annual parking pass at the country park by £22, which it said was the equivalent of just over 14p extra a day.",
    "In a recent council meeting, the decision to increase parking costs was challenged by councillor Dale Heenan, who said: \"Cabinet has approved the fees and charges for next year.",
    "\"There was no consultation on them.",
    "\"Parking at Coate Water Country Park is going up 73% for a season ticket. How do you justify that? Is it anything other than fleecing the public,\" he added.",
    "In response, Mr Small said: \"You have to have a balance and it's a large increase, but it's still a small amount of money.\"",
    "If approved, the charges will come into effect on 1 April."
